<h1>Horus</h1>
Horus is a web application developed as a university project for the course "Webtechnologie II". It includes a backend framework with various components that were covered in lectures. The project involves creating a functional design for a web application that serves as an exam tracking system, similar to Osiris. The application is written in modern PHP code, is maintainable, and adheres to PSR-1 and PSR-12 standards. The framework and application do not use external libraries, utilize a SQL database for data storage, and implement routing, templating, access control, request handling, and dependency injection.

Requires PHP 8.2 or later.
